# What is a Bioinformatician?

_A bioinformatician is a specialist who combines computer science into the area of biology by analysing large data sets such as raw genomic data for clinical and research purposes_

<!-- footer: "[A career as a bioinformatician - NSW Health](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/careers/students/Pages/careers-bioinformatician.aspx)" -->

---

# What are the different Bioinformatics roles?

- Data analyst
    - Probably has a BSc in Computer Science, Statistics or Biology
- Core-facility/consulting
    - Probably has a MSc/MPhil in Computer Science, Statistics or Biology
- Informatics/System Administration
    - Probably has a BSc in Computer Science
- Software development
    - Probably has a BSc in Computer Science
- Research fellow
    - Probably has a PhD in Computer Science, Statistics or Biology

<!-- footer: "" -->

# What do Bioinformaticians do?

- Biological data analysis (as defined by Illumina<sup>*</sup>)
    - Primary: Analysing data straight from a machine. Usually done by a machine or ancient DNA nerds
    - Secondary: Anything in between (alignment, assembly etc). Something that uses a workflow/pipeline
    - Tertiary: Biological interpretation or additional development
- Workflow development and benchmarking
- Software development
- Expertise-specific areas (i.e. clinical geneticist, infectious disease)

<!-- footer: "[Illumina: Sequencing Data Analysis Solutions](https://sapac.illumina.com/informatics/sequencing-data-analysis.html)" -->

---

# What don't Bioinformaticians do? _(usually)_

- Data interpretation

<!-- footer: "" -->

---

# What are the benefits of being a Bioinformatician?

- Data skills are a fundamental employment skill
- Trained Bioinformaticians are rare, and hence, in demand on the job market
- Options to transition to other employment
    - Common: Data scientist, software engineer, entrepreneur, clinical geneticist
    - Possible: Journalist, librarian, buisness analyst, front-end web development
- Not tied to a lab == flexible work environments possible

---

# But Jimmy, I only did a little bit of analysis in my degree. Can I claim that I'm a Bioinformatician??

---

# What is a Bioinformatician?

- Completely dry lab computational researcher? __YES__
- Wet lab researcher that does a little bit of analysis? __Also YES__
- Person who works in a lab and uses R to plot diagrams? __No__

# What CV(s) do I have?

I have **three to six** different CVs as an Academic

---

# What CV(s) do I have? 
### (Academic/Core-facility roles)
<br>

1. Institutional website page: Gives all the basic information in regards to my current role
    - Its the first thing people see when they google me

2. Google scholar: Publication metrics
    - Usually the second thing people see when they google me

3. An up-to-date LinkedIn profile: Far more important for industry roles and Senior Researchers

# Tips

---

# 1. You can't judge what you can't see
## Demonstrate your skills!

- If you've done data analysis, you need to demonstrate it for an employer
- Put ALL of your code on a public code repository (i.e. github, bitbucket)

![w:15cm center](./figures/github.png)

<!-- footer: "[Twitter](https://twitter.com/michaelroker/status/1545859378896523264?s=20&t=TvpABIsWiVyWrCD5_JxH9g)" -->

---

# NOBODY CARES THAT YOUR CODE IS SHIT

---

# You can't judge what you can't see
## Demonstrate your skills!

- Add anything that shows off your skills (examples):

1. Analysis of a public dataset using a new method
    - e.g. Grab an RNA-seq project off SRA, analyse it with a pseudo-aligner (kallisto/salmon) rather than an alignment technique
2. Run a few benchmarking tests
    - e.g. Test the speed of a new variant caller by comparing to `GATK`, `freebayes` and `samtools`


---

# 2. Choose the programming skill to fit the job and emphasise it

- If the role is for:
    - Secondary data analysis? `bash`, `perl` and command-line skills
    - Worflow development? `nextflow`, `snakemake`, `cwl`, `docker`, `singularity`
    - Software development? C/C++, `rust`, `go` 
    - Machine Learning? `python`
    - Clinical genomics/oncology? Use TCGA and run an analysis

<!-- footer: "[The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga)" -->

---

# 3. Academics will always look at your publications first

-  So put them on the front page with your employement history


<!-- footer: "" -->

---

# 4. If you like an open position, work for it

- Contact


---

# 4. A Bioinformatics CV is part of an arsenal

- Networking
- Open source software contributions
- Data citations
- Package development
